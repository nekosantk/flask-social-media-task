# **RelyComply Social Media Coding Task**

#### Problem

Our client, Morgain Stainley, needs an API with live data on the activity levels of different social networks to serve as an input to their AI trading bots. Specifically, they need an endpoint they can query to get a numeric indicator of the amount of content posted on each social network. This should be a quick little task, but the client is paying us a billion dollars so your implementation needs to be robust and fast.

#### Solution

Fortunately, weâ€™ve found some very simple endpoints that returns social media content from the last hour (don't tell the client!):

- [https://takehome.io/twitter](https://takehome.io/twitter)
- [https://takehome.io/facebook](https://takehome.io/facebook)
- https://takehome.io/instagram

A Flask server has been set up in `app.py`. Complete the provided endpoint so that it will return a JSON response with the amount of activity currently on the platform, for example `{"instagram": 4, "facebook": 9, "twitter": 3}`.

Because speed is everything in the trading world, the calls to the 3 social media endpoints need to be made in parallel, i.e. using multi-threading or async. Morgain Stainley wants their bots to be the fastest.

If you are in doubt of a detail of the spec just use your best judgement and let me know what you decided with the submission.

#### Caveat

Because some of these social networks adopted the slogan *"Move fast and break things"*, they don't always respond predictably. They break. And respond with invalid JSON. Life's hard. You will need to deal with errors as you see fit.

#### Quickstart

To get the project up and running, clone (not fork) the repo and run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask --debug run
```

The submission should just be a link to your cloned repo.
